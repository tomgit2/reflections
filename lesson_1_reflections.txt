How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Different lines are automatically detected and hence potential lines of error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Helps to find out when an error was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually saving ensures only meaningful changes are saved. If one forgets to save
the changes are lost though.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is programmer orientated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Find versions of specific changes and view the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It is always possible to revert the changes to the last state where the 
program in question was working fine.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For the Machine Learning course.
