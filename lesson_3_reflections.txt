When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working from different computers, when working with a number of people on the same project or to backup the work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  One might want to test things thouroughly first.
