When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working from different computers, when working with a number of people on the same project or to backup the work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  One might want to test things thouroughly first.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are clones from github to github, clones are taken from github or locally and branches exist locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Changes can be inspected with git log.
  
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  By email, making it harder for everyone to follow.
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  When testing, for example, new features.
